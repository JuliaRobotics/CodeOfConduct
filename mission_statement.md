# JuliaRobotics Mission Statement

JuliaRobotics is a collection of robotics-related packages that focus on robot control, simulation, navigation, and visualization. JuliaRobotics intends to provide more visibility to robotics-related work within the Julia community.  JuliaRobotics does not intend to replace functionality of other packages in the Julia ecosystem, but rather complement and improve the communication of available resources.  JuliaRobotics intends to leverage the benefits of the performance, syntax, and design benefits of the Julia language. Lastly, JuliaRobotics has a code of conduct which encourages positive, constructive collaboration, and peer review to improve access and the quality of modern robotic technology.
